# Notes
*10/10 very creative name I know*

This repository collects some notes from my attempts (with varying levels of success) 
to learn things through courses, books, websites and video lectures
- the notes are NOT market subsitutes of the actual referenced material 
  (ie some content may be obmitted)

> Rights & Content included in these notes  belongs to the their respective orignal  authors. 
> Go show them some :heart: by buying their book/course/viewing their site/
> watching their videos etc.

## Building
Since Github does not support embedded latex in markdown, the notes are
regenerated with [readme2tex](https://github.com/leegao/readme2tex)
1. Install `readme2tex` and its dependencies
2. Run `make`
