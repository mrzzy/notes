# Notes
*10/10 very creative name I know*

This repository collects some notes from my attempts (with varying levels of success) 
to learn things through courses, books, websites and video lectures
- the notes are NOT market subsitutes of the actual referenced material 
  (ie some content may be obmitted)

> Rights & Content included in these notes  belongs to the their respective orignal  authors.  
> Go show them some :heart: by buying their book/course/viewing their site/
> watching their videos etc.
